this uses arduino  + sensor which can be ultrasonic sensor or IR sensor


How ultrasonic sensor work?
Ultrasonic sensors work by emitting sound waves at a frequency too high for humans to hear. They then wait for the sound to be reflected back, calculating distance based on the time required. This is similar to how radar measures the time it takes a radio wave to return after hitting an object

how Ir sensor work?
R sensor is an electronic device, that emits the light in order to sense some object of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion. ... Photodiode is sensitive to IR light of the same wavelength which is emitted by the IR LED
